# Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis of Customer Reviews

## Project Overview
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of sentiment analysis techniques applied to customer reviews, utilizing various models including VADER, BERT, RoBERTa, and multi-label logistic regression. Our primary focus is on classifying sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories using the **Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset**.

## Objectives
- To conduct sentiment analysis on consumer reviews and classify sentiments into positive, negative, and neutral categories.
- To compare the effectiveness of different sentiment analysis models, including:
  - **VADER**: A lexicon-based method.
  - **BERT**: An advanced transformer-based model.
  - **RoBERTa**: An enhanced version of BERT.
  - **Multi-Label Logistic Regression**: A traditional machine learning approach.
- To assess the impact of various preprocessing techniques on model performance.
